          Makes Arduino send 1 character via XBee wireless to another XBee connected
          to a computer via a USB cable.

          The circuit:
          * RX is digital pin 2 (connect to TX of XBee)
          * TX is digital pin 3 (connect to RX of XBee)
         
          Based on a sketch created back in the mists of time by Tom Igoe
          itself based on Mikal Hart's example
         
        */

           Serial.println( "Arduino started sending bytes via XBee" );

           // set the data rate for the SoftwareSerial port
           xbee.begin( 9600 );
        }

          // send character via XBee to other XBee connected to Mac
          // via USB cable

          //--- display the character just sent on console ---
          Serial.println( c );
